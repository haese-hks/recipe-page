# Frontend Mentor - Recipe page solution

This is a solution to the [Recipe page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/recipe-page-KiTsR8QQKm). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## Table of contents

### Overview

This is a recipe page built with HTML, CSS, and responsive design principles. The project features a clean and user-friendly layout, optimized for both mobile and desktop screens. It includes sections for ingredients, steps, and a table of nutritional information. The design is minimalistic with a focus on readability and visual appeal.

### The Challenge

the challenge is to build out this recipe page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
